# Repeat The Sequence

This is a game designed using 8 LEDs and 8 pushbuttons, where each LED is associated with a unique pushbutton and the colour of the button is the same as the LED it is associated with. Hardware setup is done in Wokwi and the code is meant to be used with an Arduino Uno. The game begins by lighting the LEDs one by one in a specific sequence. Each LED is positioned next to a single pushbutton. When the sequence finishes, the user then attempts to press the associated pushbuttons located next to the LEDs one by one in the same sequence as shown by the LED lighting sequence. When the user presses a button the associated LED lights up, this must occur for each button press of the user. If the user presses the buttons in the same sequence an indication that they passed the level is shown by the LEDs being lit in a specific sequence, then the next level begins. The levels increase in difficulty with more complex patterns and sequences until the user finishes the game at the final level or when the user gets the sequence incorrect (by pressing the buttons in a different sequence than the one shown at the beginning of the level).
