Introduction
In this practical you will be expected to design and simulate a mini-game. 
This practical will have 3 stages, with each stage using concepts from the previous 
stage. Stage 1 will be the pre-practical and is important for stages 2 and 3 
conceptually. The simulator tool that you will use for this project is Wokwi. 
It is a new simulator but quite feature rich. 
Arduino has a webpage on how to use Wokwi 
(link: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Hack-star-Arduino/how-to-use-wokwi-arduino-simulator-in-2022-what-is-wokwi-304e6b). 
You can also check out Wokwiâ€™s documentation:

The game - Repeat the sequence
This is a game that you must design using 8 LEDs and 8 pushbuttons, 
where each LED is associated with a unique pushbutton and the colour of the button is
the same as the LED it is associated with (Hardware setup is done for you). 
The game begins by lighting the LEDs one by one in a specific sequence. Each LED is 
positioned next to a single pushbutton. When the sequence finishes, the user then 
attempts to press the associated pushbuttons located next to the LEDs one by one in 
the same sequence as shown by the LED lighting sequence. When the user presses
a button the associated LED lights up, this must occur for each button press of 
the user. If the user presses the buttons in the same sequence an indication that 
they passed the level must be shown, then the next level begins. 
The levels increase in difficulty with more complex patterns and sequences until 
the user finishes the game at the final level or when the user gets the sequence 
incorrect (by pressing the buttons in a different sequence than the one shown at the 
beginning of the level).
